# Bias Cafe

**Bias Cafe** is a forum platform designed for fan communities. It’s inspired by the look and culture of the old-school forums of the late 2000s and 2010s. The goal is to discover the engineering aspect behind forum applications and to explore old-school web designs.

It combines a forum application with a fan-centered environment as a thematic layer. Particularly, this instance of the platform focuses on creating a fan-centered environment around the K-pop girl group **Kep1er**.

Still establishing the core system...

Made with [Encore](https://github.com/glennhenry/Encore).

# Setup

1. Create `spaces` collection in MongoDB.
2. Import data from `assets/spaces.json`.
3. Create `sections` collection in MongoDB.
4. Import data from `assets/sections.json`.
5. Reload server if already run before.

# Server Manual

This guide assumes default settings set from the `venue.xml` file.

## Requirements

- **Java 25+**
- **MongoDB v8.0+**
- **Node v18.20.8 or v20.3.0, v22.0.0+** (only for docs)

## Setup

To run the server, ensure MongoDB is running on `mongodb://localhost:27017`. Then, run the following command:

```bash
.\gradlew run
```

- File and API server runs on `127.0.0.1:8080`

You can also run the server from IntelliJ IDE run plugin on `Application.kt`.

## Build

To build the server, simply run the `build.bat/sh` script. Output will be in `deploy/`. Run the deployment server using `java -jar cafe.jar`.

For manual build:

```bash
.\gradlew shadowJar
```

Server will be available on the same port as development mode. The documentation website, if built, will be available on `127.0.0.1:8080/docs`.

## Configuration

Various server settings can be configured from `venue.xml`. Secret version of the variables can be set from `venue.secret.xml`.

Every variables can be overriden from OS environment variables. For example, in PowerShell (Windows):

```ps1
$env:ENCORE_DEVMODE = "false"
$env:ENCORE_SERVER_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
java -jar cafe.jar
```

More information in [Venue.kt](https://github.com/glennhenry/Encore/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/encore/venue/Venue.kt)

## Docs

Empty documentation template ([built with Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), based on [sl-obsidian-starter](https://github.com/glennhenry/sl-obsidian-starter)) is available on `docs/`

To run the website locally on development mode:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

Docs runs on `http://localhost:4321/docs`.

For more info on setup and configuration, please see
the [official Starlight documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started/).

### How to add new page:

1. A page must be `.md` file and is enforced to have this on top of them (frontmatter):

```
---
title: Subfolder Example
slug: folderA/folderB/example
description: example
---
```

2. Replace the title appropriately. The description is optional; you can set it to be the same as the title. Any images or videos should be placed in `src/assets/`.
3. The slug is produced from the directory structure. For instance, this page is named `example.md` and is under the `folderB` within the `folderA`.
4. Next, add the page to the sidebar.
   1. Begin by editing the `astro.config.mjs`.
   2. Follow the existing sidebar link
      format. [More details on official documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/).
